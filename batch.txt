Loops
----------------------------------

While:

Set counters
:label
If (expression) (
   Do_something
   Increment counter
   Go back to :label
)

&commat;echo off
SET /A "index = 1"
SET /A "count = 5"
:while
if %index% leq %count% (
   echo The value of index is %index%
   SET /A "index = index + 1"
   goto :while
)

----------------------------------
for
FOR %%variable IN list DO do_something


Looping through Ranges
FOR /L %%variable IN (lowerlimit,Increment,Upperlimit) DO do_something

The /L switch is used to denote that the loop is used for iterating through range
----------------------------

Classic for Loop Implementation

for(variable declaration;expression;Increment) {
   statement #1
   statement #2
   
}

The Batch Script language does not have a direct for statement which is similar to the above syntax, 
but one can still do an implementation of the classic for loop statement using if statements and labels.

Following is the general flow of the classic for loop statement

Set counter
:label

If (expression) exit loop
Do_something
Increment counter
Go back to :label

@echo off 
SET /A i = 1 
:loop 

IF %i%==5 GOTO END 
echo The value of i is %i% 
SET /a i=%i%&plus;1 
GOTO :LOOP 
:END

-----------------------------------------------------------
